To open checkpoints manager creator use:
Tools > CheckPoints Manager

To use the tool with c# script, use : 
 - "Player.GetComponent<Player_Checkpoint>().teleportToCheckpoint();" --> Teleport the player to the 'current checkpoint '
 - "Player.GetComponent<Player_Checkpoint>().currentCheckpoint = checkPoint.gameObject;" --> Change the 'current checkpoint' variable.
Note that there is a 'OnTriggerEnter' event on each checkpoint that automatically change the 'current checkpoint' variable.
